# SCENARIO GENERATOR: Squirrel World
An LLM prompt for generating squirrel-based scenarios featuring a unique game setting, win condition, and gameplay experience. Variables delineated by square brackets are to be replaced with appropriate values.

## Game Setting
In a fantastical realm where sentient squirrels thrive across different habitats, players navigate complex socio-political landscapes shaped by various ideologies. Each squirrel character represents an ideological position defined within a 5D matrix of attributes: Property, Authority, Diplomacy, Combat, and Technology (scaled from 0-100).

## Win Condition
The ultimate goal is to forge alliances, negotiate treaties or outmaneuver rivals to establish a balanced consensus among the diverse factions, fostering harmony and progress in their squirrel society.

## Gameplay
Players interact with notable NPCs as they embark on quests, solve puzzles, and make decisions based on their ideological positions in the 5D matrix. The matrix consists of:

1. **Property** (P)
2. **Authority** (A)
3. **Diplomacy** (D)
4. **Combat** (C)
5. **Technology** (T)
