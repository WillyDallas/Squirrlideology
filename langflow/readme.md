# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- You should have **Python 9** installed.
    - Use [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage and install Python versions.

## Installation 📦

1. Install `pipenv` if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install --user pipenv
```

2. Navigate to your project directory (the one containing `Pipfile`):

```bash
cd WillyDev/Squirrlideology/langflow
```

3. Install the project dependencies using `pipenv`:

```bash
pipenv install
```

That's it! 🎉 You've successfully installed the dependencies for your project.

## Activate Virtual Environment ⚡️
Pipenv creates a virtual environment specific to your project. To activate the virtual environment, simply run:

```bash
pipenv shell
```

Now your terminal session is running inside the project's virtual environment, and you can use the installed packages.

## Run Langflow 🏃

```bash
langflow
```
